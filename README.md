# Models_CV
Cross-Validation functions for various models. I had built these a long time back, and do use them often.   
Note: These are equivalent to some of the latest/better methods of performing CV available now in R and Python.

1. GBM
2. GLM
3. Logistic Regression
4. Naive Bayes
5. Nearest Neighbour
6. Random Forest
